 * Was a Schedule::call() closure. Those run inside the scheduler tick: the
 * query, the fan-out and any HTTP all happen synchronously in that one process,
 * with no tries, no timeout, and no route to the admin exception dashboard —
 * and withoutOverlapping() then locks out the next run while it hangs. As a
 * queued job it retries, times out, and a failure reaches Queue::failing.
 *
 * Named for the fan-out, not the work: App\Jobs\TrackKeywordRankings is the per-item
 * job this dispatches.
