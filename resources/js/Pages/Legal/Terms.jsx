                            <h2>4. Subscriptions and Billing</h2>
                            <p>Our Service is billed on a subscription basis. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.</p>

                            <p><strong>Google Ads Spend:</strong> In addition to our subscription fee, you are responsible for all advertising spend on Google Ads. Google will bill you directly for ad spend according to their billing terms. Our subscription fee is separate from and in addition to any charges from Google Ads.</p>
                            <p>Our fees are based on a percentage of ad spend and/or a flat monthly rate as specified in your subscription plan. We reserve the right to adjust pricing with 30 days' notice.</p>

                                <li>Campaign performance can vary based on numerous factors including market conditions, competition, and seasonality</li>
                                <li>We do not guarantee specific results, return on ad spend (ROAS), click-through rates, conversion rates, or any other performance metrics</li>
